        <li>10g Freshly Grated Parmesan, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>2 cloves Garlic, finely diced</li>

        <li>Salt & Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by heating a large pot of salted water over high heat for the spaghetti. Once it comes to a boil, add the spaghetti and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat some olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the diced bacon and cook until crispy and browned. Remove the bacon and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the ground beef and cook until browned and no longer pink, breaking up any large clumps with a wooden spoon or spatula.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is browned, add the onion and garlic to the skillet and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato puree, sun-dried tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock, and red wine to the skillet. Stir well and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have melded together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti with the bolognese sauce on top, sprinkled with the crispy bacon and grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For an extra special touch, serve the spaghetti bolognese with some garlic bread and a side salad.</li>
        <li>You can use any type of ground meat you like in this recipe, such as turkey, pork, or lamb.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can puree the tomato passata in a blender or food processor before adding it to the skillet.</li>
    </ul>
