    <h1 class="t"> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Thick Sausages</li>
        <li>4 Slices of Bacon</li>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Can of Baked Beans
        </li>
        <li>2 Large Tomatoes, halved
        </li>
        <li>4 Slices of Black Pudding
        </li>
        <li>4 Slices of Toasted Bread
        </li>
        <li>Butter, as needed
        </li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper, to taste
        </li>
        <li>Olive Oil, as needed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="t">Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preheating the oven to 200Â°C. Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the halved tomatoes on it, cut side up. Drizzle them with a little bit of olive oil and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Roast them in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until they are soft and slightly caramelized.</li>
        <li>While the tomatoes are roasting, cook the sausages and bacon. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat and add a little bit of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the sausages and bacon and fry them for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil.

        </li>
        <li>In the same pan, cook the black pudding slices for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are crispy and cooked through. Remove them from the pan and keep them warm.

        </li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, heat the baked beans over low heat, stirring occasionally.

        </li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan, melt some butter over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan and fry them to your liking. You can either cook them sunny-side up, over-easy, or scrambled.

        </li>
        <li>Once everything is cooked, arrange the sausages, bacon, black pudding, and roasted tomatoes on two plates. Serve the baked beans and toasted bread on the side. Top the eggs with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and place them on the plates. Serve hot and enjoy!

        </li>
        
    </ol>
    <h2 class="t">Notes</h2>
        <li>You can use any type of sausages and bacon you like, but traditionally, English breakfast is made with pork sausages and back bacon.
        </li>
        <li>You can also add some grilled mushrooms or fried potatoes to the breakfast if you like.
        </li>
        <li>Don't forget to brew a cup of tea or coffee to complete the perfect English breakfast experience!
