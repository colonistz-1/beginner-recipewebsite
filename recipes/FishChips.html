    <h1> Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes; peeled and cut</li>
        <li>2 Cod Fillets</li>
        <li>Deep Fat Fryer and Sunflower Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Batter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>130g Plain Flour</li>
        <li>150ml Lager or Ale</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mushy Peas Recipes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frozen Peas (two handfuls)</li>
        <li>Chopped Mint leaves (4 or 5)</li>
        <li>Two Spring Onions chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preparing the potatoes. Peel them and cut them into thick chips. Rinse them in cold water to remove any excess starch and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Heat the sunflower oil in a deep fat fryer or a large, deep saucepan until it reaches 180°C.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating up, prepare the batter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, lager or ale, salt, and baking powder until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Dip the cod fillets into the batter, making sure they are well coated on all sides.</li>
        <li>Once the oil has reached the correct temperature, carefully lower the battered cod fillets into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry them for 6-8 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Remove them from the oil using the slotted spoon and place them on a wire rack to drain off any excess oil.</li>
        <li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the mushy peas. Cook the frozen peas according to the package instructions. Drain them and transfer them to a mixing bowl. Add the chopped mint leaves and spring onions, and use a fork to mash them together until you have a rough puree.</li>
        <li>Once the fish is cooked and drained, serve it hot with the chips and mushy peas on the side. Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For an extra crispy batter, you can dust the cod fillets in a little bit of cornstarch before dipping them in the batter.</li>
        <li>If you don't have a deep fat fryer, you can use a large, deep saucepan instead. Just make sure you don't fill it more than half full with oil, and be extra careful when lowering the fish into the hot oil.
        </li>
        <li>You can also serve the fish and chips with some tartar sauce and lemon wedges for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
